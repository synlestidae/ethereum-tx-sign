# ethereum-tx-sign

This is a Rust library that allows you to create and sign Ethereum transactions.
It can work completely offline and does not require external software such as Web3.
Legacy and access list transactions are supported ([EIP-155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155) and [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930) respectively).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/synlestidae/ethereum-tx-sign.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/synlestidae/ethereum-tx-sign)

## Usage

Native Rust types are used for transaction fields:

```rust
use ethereum_tx_sign::LegacyTransaction;

let new_transaction = LegacyTransaction {
    chain: 1,
    nonce: 0,
    to: Some([0; 20]),
    value: 1675538,
    gas_price: 250,
    gas: 21000,
    data: vec![/* contract code or other data */],
}
```

Signing a transaction is performed in two steps. First you get the [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) using your private key. Then sign the transaction using it.

```rust
let ecdsa = new_transaction.ecdsa(&private_key_32_bytes).unwrap();
let transaction_bytes = new_transaction.sign(&ecdsa);
```

`transaction_bytes` is now a `Vec<u8>` containing the serialized transaction ready to be sent.
